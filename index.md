|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| CPU|  Intel® Core™ i3 4 core CPU or better | - |
| RAM |    8+ GB, 256+ MB of video memory  |   100+ Mbit/s|

* Depending on the total amount of RAM on user’s workstation, the browser is allowed to allocate the restricted amount of memory, and therefore Inoe application may load not more than 16 GBytes of data. Due to these limitations, browser may run out of memory, if the user loads several large computed tomography, mammography or tomosynthesis studies.
